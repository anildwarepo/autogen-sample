      "2. **Refunds**: Initiated by the merchant to return funds to the buyer.\n",
      "3. **Bank Reversals**: Due to issues such as insufficient funds, incorrect account details, or fraudulent activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Avoid Payment Reversals:\n",
      "1. **Provide Accurate Descriptions**: Clearly describe your products or services.\n",
      "2. **Offer Good Customer Service**: Respond promptly to customer inquiries and issues.\n",
      "3. **Ensure Quality Control**: Ensure products are in good condition before shipping.\n",
      "4. **Avoid Misleading Advertising**: Be honest in your promotions.\n",
      "5. **Use Secure Payment Methods**: Verify customer information and utilize secure payment gateways.\n",
      "6. **Clearly Define Policies**: Define return, refund, and cancellation policies clearly.\n",
